# ü§î About me
Hello! I'm Camille Dugas, a passionate back-end web developer since 2016. The best way to discover me is to go on my [portfolio](https://camilledugas.me).

# üìö Technologies used
Here is the list of the main technologies I use on a daily basis. I work mainly with NestJS.

Currently I'm particularly interested in the GraphQL ecosystem and code generation because we shouldn't have to write and maintain documentions anymore, we should rather focus on features.

| Language   | Back-end              | Front-end         | Database   | Tools  |
| ---------- | --------------------- | ----------------- | ---------- | ------ |
| TypeScript | NestJS (REST/GraphQL) | React             | PostgreSQL | Git    |
| JavaScript | Fastify/Express       | NextJS (w/ React) | MongoDB    | Docker |
|            | WebSocket             | Tailwind          |            |        |
|            |                       | CSS/SCSS          |            |        |
