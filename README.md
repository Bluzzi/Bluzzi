# ü§î About me
Hello! I'm Camille Dugas, a passionate full-stack developer since 2016. More about me [here](https://camilledugas.me).

# üìö Technologies used
Here is the list of the main technologies I use on a daily basis. I work mainly with React, NextJS and NestJS.

Currently I'm particularly interested by the GraphQL ecosystem and code generation because we shouldn't have to write and maintain documentions anymore, we should rather focus on features.

| Language   | Back-end              | Front-end         | Database   | Tools         |
| ---------- | --------------------- | ----------------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| TypeScript | NestJS (REST/GraphQL) | React             | PostgreSQL | Git           |
| JavaScript | Fastify/Express       | NextJS (w/ React) | MongoDB    | Docker        |
|            | WebSocket             | CSS/SCSS/Tailwind |            | Vercel        |
|            | OpenAPI/Swagger       | Zustand/Jotai     |            | Railway       |
|            |                       | Testing Library   |            |               |
