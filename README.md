# ðŸ¤” About me
Hello! I'm Camille Dugas, a passionate full-stack web developer since 2016. I mainly work with the technologies proposed by the NodeJS universe.   

Currently, I work at Essential Tooth Box as a freelancer. I also work on two open source projects:

- [Royaume](https://github.com/Virtual-Royaume), a French developer community, we work together on various repositories in order to increase our skills
